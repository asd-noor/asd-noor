Hiring Manager

[Company Name]

Subject: Application for [Role Title] — Backend Engineering with a bias for reliability and clear interfaces

Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],

I’m applying for the [Role Title] at [Company Name]. I build backend systems that are reliable, observable, and easy to operate. My core stack is Go on Linux, with strong data and infrastructure fundamentals and enough frontend skill to ship what’s needed with React and TailwindCSS. I focus on clear interfaces, measurable performance, and operational simplicity—systems that scale without drama and earn their keep in production.

In practice, that means shipping services in Go, leaning on Python for advanced scripting, data visualization, and the occasional ML task, and using Rust where tighter control or zero-cost abstractions pay off. I’m comfortable across the Linux surface area and use containers and orchestration thoughtfully—Docker for packaging, Kubernetes for scheduling, and Terraform for repeatable infrastructure. I instrument from day one with Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki so that “works on my machine” becomes “works in prod, with dashboards.”

Data-wise, I’ve worked with PostgreSQL, MySQL, DynamoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, and InfluxDB, picking stores based on access patterns, consistency, and ops overhead. For messaging and background work, I gravitate to NATS and Asynq when low-latency fan-out or durable task processing are central. On cloud, I’m fluent in AWS and comfortable on GCP.

My academic work sharpened my engineering discipline. I published on semantic segmentation of high‑resolution satellite imagery—first on patch-wise modeling of sedimentation (Springer, 2021), then on the impact of label noise in multi-class segmentation over Bangladesh’s marine region (Taylor & Francis, 2022). This background means I sweat data quality, measurement, and reproducibility—habits that translate directly to production services and pipelines. Earlier, I earned the President’s Scout Award (2010), an experience that built practical leadership and the calm to make sound decisions under pressure.

Why this role: [1–2 sentences tying your experience to the team’s domain, scale, or technical stack—e.g., streaming, observability, ML infra, payments, etc.]

Selected highlights:
- Backend: Go (professional proficiency); Rust (intermediate); Python (advanced scripting, data viz, ML tasks); JavaScript/Lua/Bash as needed.
- Frontend: React + TailwindCSS for internal tools and dashboards.
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, DynamoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB.
- Messaging/Queues: NATS, Asynq.
- Infra/Cloud/Obs: Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform; AWS and GCP; Prometheus, Grafana, Loki.

I’d welcome the chance to discuss how I can help [Company Name] ship fast, observable services with clean interfaces and low operational overhead. Thank you for your time—looking forward to speaking soon.

Sincerely,

Asaduzzaman Noor
Software Engineer
